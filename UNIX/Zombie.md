#exit Function
* Normal termination  – Executing a return from the main function.  – Calling the exit function. ( close all standard I/O streams. )  – Calling the _exit function. ( handles the UNIX-specific details )  
– remain exit status.
* Abnormal termination  – Calling abort()  – When the process receives certain signal which can be generated by the process itself, by some other process, or by the kernel.
– don't remain exit status.

#wait and waitpid Function
– wait for child's exit. ( if it's children are still running )  
– return exit status of child ( if child is a zombie )  
– return error ( if it doesn't have any child )

* wait : wait for the first child to terminate.
* waitpid : wait for the specified child to terminate.

#Zombie
– if the process exit when the parent is not waiting for the process, it called zombie.  
– **init** process repeatedly call wait function, so child of init can't be zombie

-
#If we don't want to wait for child and to make the child to be zombie?

Make child#1 by fork(), and child#1 make child#2 by fork in itself.  
And child#2 wait for terminate of child#1 (wait for child#2 lost his parent), then it inherit to init process.  
But, we have to ensure exit of child#1 like this
